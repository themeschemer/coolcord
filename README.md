<h1>What is Coolcord?</h1>
<p>Coolcord is a <a href="https://betterdiscord.app">BetterDiscord</a> theme created by <a href="https://github.com/themeschemer">ThemeSchemer</a>, based around cool colorsâ€”mainly green, dark blue, and purple. It was created to make <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> look, well, <em>less boring.</em></p>
<h3>So what does Coolcord add?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A new color scheme</li>
  <li>New icons</li>
  <li>New animations</li>
  <li>A new logo</li>
  <li>Uppercase text channel names</li>
  <li><em>More coming soon!</em></li>
</ul>
<h1>What's yet to come?</h1>
<p>Glad you asked! Here's some of my plans for future updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New illustrations</li>
  <li>A better light mode</li>
</ul>
